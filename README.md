# LiveFlight Connect - OS X
LiveFlight Connect for OS X allows you to control Infinite Flight on an iOS or Android device via your Mac using either joystick, keyboard, or mouse. 

Uses Infinite Flight Connect, a TCP-based API introduced in version 15.10.0.

Usage
------------
  * Install the latest release version via the "Releases" tab.
  * Enable Infinite Flight Connect within Infinite Flight, and make sure your device is on the same wifi network as your Mac
  * Get your joystick setup, and go have fun :)


Modifying Source
------------
LiveFlight Connect is built in Objective-C/Swift. Simply clone the repo, run and build in Xcode! 

Compatible Devices
------------
There's no guarantee this will play perfectly with your joystick or configuration. Devices which require two USB ports need some work still. These joysticks work fine:
  * Thrustmaster T-Flight Hotas X
  * Saitek X52 Pro
  * Logitech Extreme 3D
